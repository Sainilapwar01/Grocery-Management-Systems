                <p>Many consumers equate the word “organic” with foods being “healthier.” However, there is currently no link between eating organic foods and better overall health. Organic foods can lessen your exposure to synthetic pesticides, though. And they are grown using cleaner farming methods.</p>
            <p>The term “organic” is defined and controlled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It’s based on USDA inspection and certification requirements. These are the requirements that farmers, companies, and food products must meet in order to carry the organic label. They include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Organic produce must be grown without the use of chemicals or pesticides. Farmers must use natural means to control insects and weeds. Only natural fertilizers, such as compost, are allowed. After harvesting, farmers cannot treat food with preservatives. This includes wax.</li>
                <li>Organic foods cannot have been altered by scientists.</li>
                <li>Organic farming practices must protect the land to make sure it is useful for a long time.</li>
                <li>Organic meat and animal products must come from livestock raised in a natural habitat. Farmers must give them organic feed, clean housing, and access to the outdoors. Farmers cannot use growth hormones or antibiotics. These products are given to non-organic livestock.</li>
                <p>Organic farming has two main goals. The first is to reduce the negative impact on the environment. The second is to increase sustainability.</p>
