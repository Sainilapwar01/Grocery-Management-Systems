            <h1>What are online payments?</h1>
            <p>Online payments refer to the electronic exchange of currency through the internet. These payments usually consist of the transfer of monetary funds from a customer's bank or debit or credit card account, into the seller's bank account, in exchange for products or services. These funds can come directly from a customer's credit card or checking account, or from an online payment system that is linked to both the buyer and seller's bank accounts. </p>
            <p>Online payments are used by buyers of goods and services, and the sellers of those goods and services. Several steps occur with the funds when they are transferred and received, especially between the two parties, that often require different types of software to successfully facilitate the transaction. The typical steps are below:</p>
            <h4>Online purchase is made:</h4><p>A customer (buyer) provides the necessary information (debit or credit card, checking account information, etc.) to pay for goods or services. This data is then sent to a payment processing software or payment gateway.</p>
            <h4>Information is encrypted: </h4><p>The payment gateway encrypts the payment details, such as the customer's name, address, and bank account info, which provides a level of security to make it more difficult for this info to be stolen.</p>
            <h4>Details are verified: </h4><p> After the transaction data is encrypted, the information is sent to a payment processor to ensure that the transaction is valid. Once the transfer is verified, it sends the info to the buyer’s and seller’s banks.</p>
            <h4>Funds are approved: </h4><p>Assuming there are no red flags from the payment gateway or processor, the banks authorize the transaction. There are, however, several reasons as to why a transaction might not be approved by either bank:</p>
            <h4>Funds are requested</h4><p>After the funds and corresponding transfer are approved, the payment processor requests the funds to be sent from the buyer's source of funds to the seller's bank account.</p>
            <h4>The seller receives funds:</h4><p>The transfer of funds is completed and the purchase price has been sent from buyer to seller.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Types of online payments</h1>
            <h4>Credit cards:</h4><p>This is a payment issued from a financial institution that lends money to the cardholder, which allows them to purchase products and services online. Using credit cards for purchases is a popular type of online payment because the buyer usually has little to no liability for fraudulent charges, and most sellers accept this type of payment.</p>
            <h4>Debit cards:</h4><p>Using debit cards (sometimes referred to as check cards or bank cards) for online purchases deducts the price directly from the user’s bank account. Similar to credit cards, the purchaser is often protected from unauthorized charges, and debit cards are widely accepted online.</p>
            <h4>Third-party payment services: </h4><p>These online and mobile services help facilitate the sending and receiving of payments online between buyer and seller. Once a bank account is attached to a third-party payment service, transactions can often be made via mobile phones, tablets, smartwatches, and within apps.</p>
